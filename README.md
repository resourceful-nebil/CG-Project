This project is a solar system simulation implemented using the Three.js library. It displays a 3D representation of the solar system, including the sun and the planets, with realistic textures and animations.

## Preview

![Solar System Simulation][]

## Deployment

The project is deployed and accessible at [https://cg-group-project.netlify.app][].

## Features

- Realistic representation of the sun and planets.
- Texturing of celestial bodies using images.
- Self-rotation of celestial bodies.
- Orbiting of planets around the sun.
- Realistic lighting effects.
- Interactive camera controls using OrbitControls.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Three.js
- OrbitControls
- HTML
- CSS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-system-simulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd solar-system-simulation
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- Use the mouse to orbit around the scene and zoom in/out.
- The planets will rotate on their own axis.
- The planets will also orbit around the sun.
